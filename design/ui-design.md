A great UI for Raise the Paw should be charming, tactile, and clear, emphasizing the push-your-luck tension and the personality of each cat. Here's a breakdown of how the UI could work across the main phases of the game:
🧾 Overall UI Design Principles

    Visual Style: Clean, colorful, with soft drop shadows and playful rounded shapes.

    Tone: Cute corporate—think pastel spreadsheets, cat-sized laptops, and big bold buttons.

    Font: Chunky but readable (like Baloo or Fredoka One).

    Animations: Snappy and satisfying. Cards flip, earnings sparkle, Snap cards shake the screen.

    Sound: Office ambiance with purring, soft meows for UI hovers, dramatic “SLAM” for Snap card.

🪑 Main Game Screen – The Boardroom
Layout

    Top-Center: Round Tracker ("Monday" to "Friday" with silly calendar icons)

    Center Stage: The Boardroom Table

        Cats sit around the table, animated idly (grooming, typing on laptops, sipping coffee).

        The active cat’s seat is highlighted with a spotlight or raised platform.

    Bottom Center (Player Turn):

        Large draw deck labeled “Raise Deck” with animated card shuffles.

        Cards drawn fan out above the deck.

        Buttons:

            Draw Again 🐾

            Bank It! 💼

    Bottom Left: Tooltip area showing card descriptions and flavor text on hover.

    Bottom Right: Player's stats:

        Name, power, current total money, reprimands

        Cat icon (purrs or reacts to draw outcomes)

Other Cats’ Info

    Above each seated cat:

        Nameplate (Miss Meowgan, Sir Pouncelot, etc.)

        Mini card pile (face down)

        Visible money pile and power icon

        Speech bubble reactions (jealous, smug, panicked)

🃏 Card Draw UX

    Every Draw:

        Smooth card pull animation from deck to the table.

        Offer cards show with a ka-ching sparkle.

        Snap cards cause screen shake, red vignette, dramatic meow gasp SFX.

        Perk cards bounce into view, with quirky animations.

    Optional: Suspense Meter

        A risk meter that fills with each card drawn (like a cat paw creeping toward the "SLAP" button).

        Glows red if Snap odds are high.

🧶 Between Rounds Screen

    Overview:

        Daily Summary Email from the CEO (fake memo style)

        Money earned

        Round leaderboard with cats posing or sulking

    Unlocks:

        “New Cat Unlocked!” splash with animations

        New cosmetic earned? You get a badge or title on your cat’s desk

    Cat Picker (if unlocked):

        Side-scroll roster of cats with bios, powers, and stats

        Your current chosen cat is animated and highlighted

        "Bring to Work!" button

🏢 Menu UI (Main Menu / Pause Menu)

    Background: A cozy corner office with framed pictures of cats in power suits.

    Options as desktop items:

        New Game – giant red “Urgent” button

        Continue – folder labeled “In Progress”

        Options – coffee mug with a gear logo

        Unlockables – filing cabinet drawer opens to show collectibles

        Credits – plaque that reads “Employee of the Meowth”
