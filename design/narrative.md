## Game Intro Version:

### WELCOME TO WHISKR! 😸

MEOW-WOW! You've just been hired at WHISKR, the most PAW-some social media company in the world! Every cat with a smartphone uses Whiskr to share their napping spots and cute selfies!

🎮 YOUR MISSION 🎮
The big boss cat has approved your team's MEOW-velous new project - but there's a cat-astrophe brewing! Six department teams are all fighting over the budget! 

💰 It's time to put on your business suit, sharpen your claws, and negotiate for the BIGGEST pile of cash! 💰

Each day this week, you'll sit at the boardroom table with other corporate kitties and try to grab money from the budget pile! But be careful... if you get too greedy, the CEO might SNAP at you and you'll lose EVERYTHING you collected that day!

Will you play it safe and take a small pile of coins? Or will you risk it all and try to stuff your kitty bank until it overflows?

Remember: In the corporate cat world, fortune favors the BOLD... but curiosity killed the quarterly bonus!

GOOD LUCK, BUSINESS CAT! Make your department purr-oud!
