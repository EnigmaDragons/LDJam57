- Backgrounds can be simple 2D illustrations
- Animations should be simple transforms (scale, position, rotation)
- Use the game's existing color scheme
- Add subtle cat-themed sound effects (purring, meowing) during transitions
- Background music should be light corporate jazz with occasional cat noises

## Technical Requirements:
- Each scene should be a separate prefab
- Use Unity's UI system for text
- Implement simple animation system using DOTween
- Keep asset sizes small for quick loading
