<size=24>This game is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual corporate cultures,
living or dead cats, or workplace dysfunction is purely coincidental
and frankly a little too real for comfort.</size>

<size=24>No corporate executives were harmed in the making of this game,
though several were satirized mercilessly.</size>
