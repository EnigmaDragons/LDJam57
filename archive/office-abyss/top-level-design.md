Below is an expanded concept for Office Abyss—a comedic, minimal auto-battler set in a cartoonish corporate world, where you lead a motley crew of office workers through a series of floors to uncover R&D lab secrets. The focus is on fun, synergy, and quick battles rather than deep strategy, making it a perfect jam project.
Elevator Pitch

You’re the “Team Lead” of a quirky office crew determined to infiltrate the corporation’s forbidden R&D lab hidden in the depths of the building. Each floor is guarded by a themed “department boss” (HR, PR, IT Security, etc.). Recruit cartoonish office archetypes—like The Intern, The IT Guru, or The Janitor—and watch them auto-battle comedic enemies with staple guns and coffee pot buffs. Your goal: claw your way to the bottom floor and reveal the secret project R&D has been hiding!
Core Loop

    Recruit/Upgrade Phase

        At the start (and after each floor), you pick which new employee(s) to hire or which existing ones to upgrade.

        You have a limited budget (“Office Budget,” “Payroll Points,” or “Company Credit”), which resets or gets replenished each floor.

    Prepare Formation

        You can arrange your employees in a simple formation (like front row/back row or maybe just a linear order).

        Simple synergy bonuses can be triggered by adjacency or team composition (e.g., having the Manager next to the Intern might boost the Intern’s morale, etc.).

    Auto-Battle Encounter

        Each floor or department presents a short auto-battle sequence: your employees automatically attack using office-themed moves (stapler throws, coffee splashes, legal threats).

        The enemy side is a handful of cartoon corporate drones/bots or another department’s staff with comedic office attacks.

    Victory & Rewards

        After winning, you get “Corporate Loot” (which might be new employees, “office perks,” or raises to power up your existing staff).

        Progress deeper until you reach the final R&D level.

Departments & Boss Floors

To keep scope small, you could do 3 floors + a final boss:

    Floor 1: HR Headache

        Enemies: HR reps who use “Paperwork Overload” or “Mandatory Training” moves to stun your team.

        Boss: HR Director with an ability to shuffle your formation or force your employees to lose a turn if they fail compliance checks.

    Floor 2: Security Scramble

        Enemies: Security Guards, Attack Drones.

        Boss: Chief Security Officer, who can place “Badge Check” debuffs or physically block your front line.

    Floor 3: Legal Gauntlet

        Enemies: Lawyers or paralegals with “Cease & Desist” attacks that slow or hamper your team.

        Boss: Head of Legal—their special “Lawsuit Avalanche” drains your team’s morale.

    Final Boss: R&D Revelation

        You discover a “Secret Experiment”—maybe a comically high-tech corporate robot or a mutated office supply beast.

        Defeat it to claim the hidden research data.

(If time is tight, compress this to 2 floors + 1 final boss.)
Example Characters (Cartoonish Archetypes)

    The Intern

        Cost: Very cheap to hire.

        Ability: “Coffee Run”—randomly gives a small buff to an ally’s speed or damage.

        Flaw: Low HP, easily “overworked.”

    The IT Guru

        Role: Ranged DPS or debuffer.

        Ability: “System Crash”—chance to inflict a short stun or slow on an enemy.

        Synergy: Gains a bonus if next to The Manager or with other Tech employees.

    The Manager

        Role: Support/Buff.

        Ability: “Team Meeting”—small AoE buff to allies’ attack or speed.

        Synergy: If placed behind any employee (like The Intern), that employee gets morale boosts.

    The Legal Eagle

        Role: Debuffer.

        Ability: “Cease & Desist”—temporary ability lock on an enemy.

        Synergy: Gains extra power if the enemy is in a “leadership” position (boss or manager).

    The Janitor

        Role: Cleanse/Healer.

        Ability: “Mop It Up”—removes negative statuses from an ally or from the entire team occasionally.

        Synergy: Gains defense bonus if placed in the front (hardened from tough conditions).

    The Sales Rep

        Role: Quick attacker or morale booster.

        Ability: “Sales Pitch”—chance to bribe or temporarily convert an enemy minion for a turn.

        Flaw: Lower base HP; relies on persuasion instead of raw strength.

(You only need 5–6 total employees to keep scope small. Or even fewer if you prefer.)
Synergy & Simple Stats

    Keep stats minimal:

        HP (Hit Points)

        ATK (Attack Power)

        SPD (Attack Speed or turn frequency)

        Possibly a single “Ability” each.

    Synergy Example:

        Manager + Intern: The Intern’s Coffee Run triggers 50% more often.

        IT Guru + Sales Rep: “Remote Sales Demo” synergy, letting them do a special combined attack.

        Janitor + Manager: “Clean Slate”—the Janitor’s cleanses also restore a small bit of HP if Manager is on the team.

Keep synergy simple and comedic—just enough to reward certain combos without heavy code complexity.
Game Progression & Flow

    Title Card + Quick Setup:

        Minimal story: “Welcome to [Corp Name]. The R&D secrets lie below. Gather your team, break the bureaucracy, and unravel the truth!”

    Floor Sequence (3 floors + final):

        Recruit (spend office budget)

        Prepare Formation

        Auto-Battle

        Win → Gather Rewards → Next Floor

    Final Boss:

        Extra comedic text or a bigger “office monster.”

        If you win, show a short comedic “secret revealed!” cutscene.

Visual & Thematic Style

    Cartoon Office: Big-headed cartoon characters, silly idle animations.

    Attacks: Over-the-top office objects (paperclip barrage, coffee splash, stapler toss).

    UI: A “cubicle-like” or “office intranet” theme for menus.

    Environment: Each floor can have a different background art or color scheme (HR floor: motivational posters, Security floor: metal detectors, etc.).

Scope Tips

    Limit the number of employees to 5–6 total. Not all of them have to appear in one run—players pick from a smaller random pool.

    Limit floors to 2–3 plus a final boss to keep your content creation manageable.

    Auto-Battler: You only need to code a simple turn-based or real-time “attack in order” system—no complicated AI required.

    Minimal Animations: You can use simple 2D sprite “bobs” or low-poly 3D with minimal rigging. Even static images with tweened positions can work.

    Short Jokes & Flavor: Let text windows or short AI-generated lines deliver comedic flair.

Potential Twist: “R&D Secrets” Reveal

    Let the final “secret” be something silly:

        A giant coffee machine that can produce infinite coffee.

        An experimental copy machine that clones office documents into real creatures.

        A “Cat Division” in R&D (tying in with your cat preference from earlier) which developed super-intelligent corporate cat employees.

This comedic payoff can be done in a 30-second cutscene or a text-based reveal.
Final Thoughts

Office Abyss is designed to be simple but charming:

    Auto-battler ensures minimal gameplay complexity: players set up formations and watch the comedic fights.

    Recruit/Upgrade phases keep engagement and replayability.

    Cartoonish corporate theme stands out in a jam setting—humor and silly synergy mechanics can really shine.

It’s a great sweet spot for a 72-hour jam: you focus on fun character designs, comedic writing, and a single tight gameplay loop, rather than an extensive overworld or complex story. Good luck with your Office Abyss infiltration—hope you uncover those secret corporate coffee formulas in style!
