## Full Description

### The Corporate Cat-astrophe
Welcome to WHISKR, the most PAW-some social media company in the world! Your team's MEOW-velous new project, SnapCat, is the next big thing in feline social media. But there's a problem - six department teams are fighting over the budget!

### The Game
- Draw cards to collect cash for your department
- Each decision takes you deeper into corporate intrigue
- The deeper you go, the more the CEO watches
- Play as unique cat characters with special powers
- Risk it all for a kitty bank that overflows, or play it safe with a small pile of coins

### Features
- **Strategic Depth**: Each decision affects your standing in the corporate hierarchy
- **Unique Cat Characters**: Each with special powers that change how you play
- **Risk vs Reward**: Push your luck or play it safe - the choice is yours
- **Corporate Cat Theme**: A fresh take on corporate life with feline flair
- **Card-Based Mechanics**: Simple to learn, challenging to master

### Theme Connection
The "Depth" theme is reflected in the corporate hierarchy and the escalating risks you take. Each decision takes you deeper into the corporate jungle, where the stakes get higher and the CEO's watchful eye grows more intense. How deep are you willing to go for that budget? Will you stay in the shallows of safety, or dive deep into risky territory?

### Development Notes
Created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 57, DEEP MEOWGOTIATIONS combines strategic depth with feline corporate chaos. The game was inspired by the tension of corporate budget meetings and our love for cats who think they own the world.
