# Deep Meowgotiations: UI Design Guidelines

Based on our established art direction, here are revised UI design guidelines for "Raise the Paw":

## Core Visual Style
- **Line Work**: Semi-polished linework with defined edges in a newspaper comic style - clean but not overly refined strokes that give character without being messy
- **Color Palette**: Vibrant but not overwhelming - orange, teal, cream, and navy as primary colors that pop without causing visual fatigue
- **Shapes**: Clean, simple shapes with visible outlines and rounded corners for UI elements - avoiding complex or realistic forms
- **Depth**: Minimal shadowing and subtle highlights for a slightly dimensional but mostly flat appearance - not fully 3D but not completely flat either

## Typography
- **Primary Font**: Fredoka One or similar chunky, rounded font for headers and important text
- **Secondary Font**: Clean sans-serif for descriptions and smaller text
- **Text Hierarchy**: Bold, larger text for names and titles, regular weight for descriptions
- **Colors**: Dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark backgrounds for optimal readability

## UI Elements
- **Cards & Containers**:
  - Thick outlined borders (2-3px) in dark colors that stand out clearly
  - White/cream backgrounds with subtle texture
  - 5:7 ratio for character cards, showing characters from roughly chest up
  - Round corners (8-10px radius)

- **Buttons**:
  - Slightly raised appearance
  - Bold colored fills (orange for primary actions, navy for secondary)
  - Thick outlines that define the button shape clearly
  - Clear hover/pressed states with subtle animation

- **Icons & Decorative Elements**:
  - Paw prints and dollar signs as motifs throughout the interface
  - Simple, bold iconography with outlines - easily recognizable at small sizes
  - Stylized cat whisker Whiskr company logo integrated throughout the UI

## Screens & Layout
- **Main Menu**:
  - Corporate lobby aesthetic with cat company branding - a sleek modern reception area with the Whiskr logo prominently displayed
  - Clean, spacious layout with clear navigation - not cluttered or overwhelming
  - Prominent "Play" button

- **Game Board**:
  - Boardroom table as the central element - an oval conference table that serves as the game space
  - Character portraits showing corporate cats from chest up with expressive faces around the edges
  - Card area in the center with clear delineation

- **Character Selection**:
  - Single prominent character card in focus - showing a corporate cat character with their distinct personality traits
  - Left/right navigation arrows
  - Stats and abilities clearly labeled
  - Department badges as visual indicators (Tech Development, Legal Department, Security, Finance, Executive Suite)

## Animation & Feedback
- **Transitions**: Quick, snappy movements between screens
- **Interactions**: Slight bounce or pop when elements are selected
- **Card Draws**: Smooth pull animations with appropriate sound effects
- **Risk Indication**: Visual cues in comic style (like small sweat drops or exclamation marks)

## Audio Design
- **UI Sounds**: Quick, satisfying clicks and swipes
- **Ambient**: Light office background noises
- **Character Sounds**: Short meows or purrs for reactions
- **Special Events**: Dramatic "SLAM" for Snap cards

This unified style creates a cohesive experience that balances the corporate theme with the playful cat characters, maintaining the newspaper comic aesthetic while ensuring clear user interaction.
