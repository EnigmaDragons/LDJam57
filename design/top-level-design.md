🎮 Game Title: Deep Meowgotiations
🧶 Core Loop

    6 Cats (1 player + 5 AI)

    5 Rounds total (a work week!)

    Each round, cats take turns trying to negotiate the best deal (aka: make the most money).

    At the end of 5 rounds, the cat with the most total money wins.

    Between rounds, unlock new playable cats with unique negotiation styles (powers).

🐾 Push-Your-Luck Mechanics

Each turn, a cat "enters the boardroom" and draws from the Raise Deck:

    Offer Cards (+$ amount): Add to your offer

    Perk Cards (company perks): Optional bonuses or risk mitigators

    CEO Snap Cards (cat-astrophic): Lose all money this turn and get “Reprimanded” (could be flavor or a light penalty)

    Corporate Shenanigans (random events): Small modifiers like “Mandatory Trust Fall – Shuffle cards with next cat”

Your Choices:

    Keep drawing = more money

    Stop early = bank your earnings

You can draw up to 6 cards, but there are 3 Snap cards shuffled into the deck (more appear as game progresses). Odds get worse the longer you push.
🐱 Starting Cats (examples)

Each cat has a passive trait or once-per-day (round) ability:

    Tabby Tom – Beginner Cat

        Ability: None (balanced stats)

    Miss Meowgan – PR Specialist

        Ability: Can discard 1 Snap card per round

    Whiskers – Finance Analyst

        Ability: +10% bonus on all Offer Cards

    Sir Pouncelot – Risk Taker

        Ability: Can draw 1 extra card beyond limit, but doubles Snap risk

    Neko-chan – Kawaii Distraction

        Ability: Can steal 1 Offer Card from another cat once per round

🏆 Between Games

    Win or reach certain conditions to unlock new cats

    Maybe even unlock Corporate Titles (like “Assistant Meownager”) for persistent cosmetic flair

    Light story progression (e.g. "The CEO is getting suspicious...")

🗂️ Possible Presentation

    UI has a Boardroom Table where cats are seated

    Each cat’s hand/earnings shown in front of them

    When it's your turn, the camera zooms in, dramatic music as you draw cards

    Snap card = the CEO SLAMS a paw on the table

Is there a name like Deep Negotiation, but that also is a cat pun?
